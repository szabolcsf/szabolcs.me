With the cooling air, provided by the monsoon surge, there's a unique opportunity in December-January to run-commute from the office to home for those of us in Singapore lucky enough to have some sort of PCN connection between our office and home. Being the opportunistic sport enthusiast as I am, I jumped on in. However, one question came about:

## How to carry my stuff for this?

I need to fit a pair of running shoes, a change of clothes and a few small items, such as access cards and earbuds case. At the same time, I don't want to carry anything bulky, so my go-to gym backpack, which measures around 35L, was out of question.

So the first few times I just used whatever I had around: a [drawstring bag](https://www.nike.com/sg/w/drawstring-bags-3375m). Totally won't recommend it, the strings cut in my shoulders, causing skin injury and discomfort.

To resolve these issues, I was doing some research on the subject, and initially was looking at "running backpacks" as well as relatedly, "hiking backpacks". However, I don't like the overall look of these backpacks, a lot of them are more like a vest rather than a bag, and most of them heavily focus on the hydration pack features, which I don't need.

After a while I figured out there are so called "day backpacks". From here, it was almost one straight shot to come around:

## [The Osprey Daylite 13L backpack](https://www.osprey.com/eu/osprey-daylite)

It has enough space for my stuff and has a harness system to prevent the bag from flapping around when I'm running. With only one 9km run down, the first impressions are good: it fits well without any sort of bouncing or moving, comfortable enough on my shoulders. I can imagine I will be able to use this bag for some of my travels too down the road.

Reviews generally mention the high quality of 300D PET packcloth (whatever that means?) material used for it. Let's see how it works out on the longer term.

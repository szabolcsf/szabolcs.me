# Living in Singapore as a Hungarian – My Reddit AMA Recap

I recently did an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit's r/AskHungary about what it's been like living in Singapore for the past six years. The response was awesome, and I got a whole bunch of questions about daily life, culture, work, and more. Would you guess what was the most common question? It was about bubble gum! Yeah, that's the first thing that comes to mind when Hungarians think of 
Singapore! Below, I've put together a casual summary of the most common topics that came up, along with my personal thoughts.

---

## Cost of Living in Singapore

**Q:** Is it as expensive to live in Singapore as people say?

**A:** Tl;dr: yes. Longer version: Singapore routinely ranks among the most expensive cities in the world. The biggest cost you'll face is rent—properties are pricey, and even a small studio can cost a lot more than a similar place back in Hungary. Eating out, however, can be quite wallet-friendly if you stick to hawker centers (think food courts with local delights). Groceries, especially imported products, can be a bit steep, so it's all about balance and lifestyle choices.

## Work and Career Opportunities

**Q:** How did you find work in Singapore, and how easy is it now?

**A:** I work in the tech industry, which is pretty welcoming for expats. In fact, Singapore has a strong market for professionals in finance, IT, and engineering. Just keep in mind that over the years, work visa policies have tightened, and the government is trying to prioritize hiring locals. So, while there are still good jobs to be found, you'll need solid qualifications and some perseverance.

## Daily Life and Cultural Differences

**Q:** What's day-to-day life like in Singapore compared to Hungary?

**A:** Singapore feels super organized and efficient. The public transport system is top-notch, the city is clean and safe, and everything seems to just work. The biggest adjustment for me was the weather—hot and humid all year round. Say goodbye to four seasons! But I do love how multicultural it is; I meet people from all over the world, and there's a fantastic variety of food and cultural activities to explore.

## Food and Hawker Centers

**Q:** How's the food? And do you miss Hungarian dishes?

**A:** Singapore is literally a food paradise, thanks to Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Western influences. Hawker centers are your best bet for tasty, budget-friendly meals. While I'm constantly discovering new foods to love, I can't help but miss good old Hungarian bread, salami, and home-cooked meals. Sometimes, you just need a taste of home.

> **AMA Note on Local Coffee and Kaya Toast:**  
> One popular local breakfast is *kaya toast*—a sweet coconut-and-egg jam spread on buttered toast. It's often served with soft-boiled eggs (which you can season with soy sauce and pepper), plus a robusta-based local coffee that's much stronger than typical European coffee. Locals roast the beans with butter or sugar, giving it a unique, bold flavor.

## Language and Communication

**Q:** Do you need to know Chinese or Malay to get around?

**A:** You'll be happy to hear that English is an official working language in Singapore. Most signage, official documents, and day-to-day conversations happen in English, so you'll do just fine without Mandarin or Malay.

---

## Housing and Living Arrangements

**Q:** Do you rent or own property in Singapore?

**A:** I rent, as many expats do here. Property prices are sky-high, and rules for foreigners buying property can be challenging. Most expats end up in condos or HDB flats (the public housing system), depending on what fits their budget and lifestyle.

---

## Travel and Weekend Activities

**Q:** What do you do for fun in Singapore?

**A:** Over the weekend, I love exploring nature reserves, sport activities, or sampling local cuisines. Another big perk: Singapore's a gateway for Southeast Asian travel. It's easy to hop over to Malaysia, Thailand, or Indonesia for a quick getaway.

---

## Differences Between Singapore and Hungary

**Q:** What do you think Singapore does better than Hungary?

**A:** Top marks to Singapore for public safety, infrastructure, cleanliness, and efficiency. This is one of the safest places I've ever been, and everything is designed to run smoothly. It's pretty impressive.

---

## Dangerous Animals and Wildlife
**Q:** Do you ever encounter snakes or other scary creatures?  
**A:** Despite the urban setting, Singapore still has nature reserves filled with wildlife. It's rare to see a snake wandering city streets, but it can happen in parks or forested areas. Monkeys, especially around places like MacRitchie Reservoir, can be more of a nuisance. They'll snatch food if you're not careful! That said, actual danger is minimal.

---

## Strict Laws and Punishments
**Q:** Are the stories about draconian laws (e.g., public urination, drug use) real?  
**A:** They do have strict rules. Public urination can lead to significant fines, and the country is extremely serious about drug offenses—certain quantities can lead to very severe penalties, including the death penalty. For everyday behavior, though, if you respect the rules (no littering, no jaywalking, etc.), you'll be fine.

---

## Local "Alternative" Culture
**Q:** What about live music or "alt" (less mainstream) scenes in Singapore?  
**A:** There *are* a few indie music venues, small art-house cinemas, and alternative festivals, but they're relatively niche. Singapore is known for being more mainstream in entertainment, yet you can still find spots for art films or local/underground music. You just have to look a little harder to find them.

---

## Bubble Gum in Singapore

**Q:** Is it true that bubble gum is illegal in Singapore?

**A:** This question came up repeatedly in the AMA! Here's the gist:

- Selling or importing chewing gum for commercial purposes is prohibited without special permission.  
- You *can* bring a small amount for personal use.  
- Spitting or sticking gum in public is a big no-no—fines can run around 500 SGD.  
- Medicinal or dental gums (like nicotine gum) are allowed but require a prescription or must be bought at pharmacies.  

So while you won't necessarily go to jail for enjoying gum in private, the laws keep gum off the streets and trains. They're definitely strict, but it's not the draconian nightmare that rumors sometimes make it out to be.

## Final Thoughts

All in all, living in Singapore has been an incredible journey. While the high costs and strict regulations can be challenging at times, the overall quality of life, the job opportunities, and the chance to experience such a unique blend of cultures make it worthwhile.
